Only come here once a day at hurtin' time
Payday, Charley knows I'm good for every dime
And I ease up on the barstool where I ease my pain
I'm just strong enough to face that lonely night again

Oh the power, the powers of drinkin'
And it's foolin' all of my native thinkin'
And it hurts so good I never notice the sinkin'
Thanks a lot to positive drinkin'

Instrumental

Well Charley always let me take a bottle home
After all, a man he can't fake it when he's all alone
And when the whiskey's talkin' I can't hear your memory
'Cause a little drinkin' drowns out a lot of you and me

Oh the power, the powers of drinkin'
And it's foolin' all of my native thinkin'
And it hurts so good I never notice the sinkin'
Thanks a lot to positive drinkin'

Thanks a lot to positive drinkin'
