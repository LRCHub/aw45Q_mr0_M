One or Eight
Levitate
Feelin' that power
We make an entrance just me and my boys
Talk to me nice over all of this noise
You wanna turn up I can't turn you down
I'll take you higher
Heart pumpin' don't slow me down
Spotlight is on us right now
Keep going another round
Around and round
And just when you think you're safe
Everybody. SHH.
I can, I can,
I can feel the power, power, power
I can feel the power, power turn up
I can feel the power, power, power
I can feel the power it's turning me up
I can feel the power
Aye It's a hearse
I'm making deals with all of my demons
Rise from the ashes no longer defeated
Leave all my enemies broken in pieces
Show me up (what's that sound), Imma go off ya
I'm gonna put it on replay
Step on the scene they (bow)
Twin jump in, I'm gassing them up like a freeway
Heart pumpin' don't slow me down
Spotlight is on us right now
Keep going another round
Around and round
And just when you think you're safe
Everybody. SHH.
I can, I can,
I can feel the power, power, power
I can feel the power, power turn up (turn it up)
I can feel the power, power, power (crank it up)
I can feel the power it's turning me up
I can feel the power
I can feel the
I can feel the
I can feel the power it's turning me up
I can feel the power
I know I'm better now but I paid the price
Been a lonely road but it's still all mine
Everything to prove burning in my eyes
(burning in my eyes burnin' in my)
I can feel the power, power, power
I can feel the power, power turn up
I can feel the power, power, power
I can feel the power it's turning me up
I can feel the power
